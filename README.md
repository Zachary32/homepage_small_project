# homepage_small_project

This is one of my first basic websites that can be adapted to be used on a mobile device and will change size dependant on the size of the window.

When you first open the website please open on the Homepage as this is the most ideal place to start on the website. Along the top of the page you will buttons
that will take you to different pages of the website.

Firstly on the homepage, the main feature of this page is a bouncing arrow that can be clicked and this will take you down the page without scrolling, then at the bottom
of the page another arrow will take you to the top of the page. I used keyframes for the bouncing arrow animation as well as the change of colour of the arrow.

On the music page, the main feature of this page is the two clickable buttons that will play music videos alongside of the positioning of the text near the top of the
page next to the concert picture.

The animal page has a main feature of all the animal pictures in a grid. I wanted the grid to be 4x4 therefore even when adjusting the size of the window it will stay
in the grid formation however the pictures inside the grid will change size.

Finally the travel page, the main feature of this page is the change of the background colour. This uses JavaScript to make this happen there is also a random background
colour button that selects essentially multiple random numbers or letters being a-e and 0-9 this combination within a random order of 6 alongside a "#" in front will
print a random colour and be placed as the background of the page.
